# Introducing Myself and My Works

Hello, I am a pure matematician and doing research in the field of artificial intenlligence. If you want to know more about me please visit my <a href="https://mdarafathkhan.github.io/Introducing-Myself-and-My-Works/">web page</a>. I took an initiative to put my notes while I learn new topics into github. The primary reason is to share with others who are interested and the secondary reason is to take advantage of this beautiful platform to compile all my notes in one place.

## Topics
- <a href="https://github.com/MdArafatHKhan/Coding-Problems-and-Solutions">Coding Problems and Solutions</a> : This repository contains the solutions of some coding puzzles from various sources.
- <a href="https://github.com/MdArafatHKhan/Differential-Geometry">Differential Geometry</a> : This is an initiative to brush up the studies I did on this topic while doing my PhD.
- <a href="https://github.com/MdArafatHKhan/Quantum-Computing">Quantum Computing</a> : A sudden desire to learn quantum computing is the reason to create this repository.
