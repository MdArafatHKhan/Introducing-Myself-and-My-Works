            src="images/bioicon.png" alt="home" />Welcome to my personal page</h2>
        <p>I was born and brought up in <a
            href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bangladesh/@23.5888284,88.1002644,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x30adaaed80e18ba7:0xf2d28e0c4e1fc6b!8m2!3d23.684994!4d90.356331">Bangladesh</a>.
          My schooling started with <a href="http://www.glabdhaka.edu.bd/">Government Laboratory High School</a>
          where I studied from 1st grade to 10th grade. Then I went to <a href="https://dhakacollege.edu.bd/">Dhaka
            College</a>
          and finished my 11th and 12th grade education. I did my undergrad and <a
            href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/AcademicInformation/OrdinanceMastersDegreeProgram">Master of Science</a>
          from
          the department of
          <a href="http://eee.buet.ac.bd/">Electrical & Electronic Engineering</a> from
          <a href="http://www.buet.ac.bd/">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>.
          I also worked as an instructor in different universities in Bangladesh.
          I first came to the United States in 2013 and started my
          PhD in <a href="https://www.unr.edu/cee">Civil & Environmental Engineering</a> at
          the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/">University of Nevada, Reno</a>. While in Reno,
          I audited some math and physics courses like diffrential geometry, mathematical physics and functional
          analysis
          and
          I really got intereseted in more abstract branches of mathematics. Solving mathematical problems was becoming
          a
          daily routine
          for me. Then I decided to switch to mathematics and moved to
          <a

          I started my degree for <a
            href="https://www.utdallas.edu/academics/fact-sheets/nsm/phd-mathematics/?d=1671">PhD
            in Mathematics</a>
          at the <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/math/">department of Mathematical Sciences</a> in the
          <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/">University of Texas at Dallas</a> in Fall 2015 and
          finished my PhD concentrating in pure mathematics in Summer 2020. While doing my PhD I
          also obtained a <a
            href="https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/programs/nsm/mathematics#master-of-science-in-mathematics">Master
            of Science in Mathematics</a>
          specializing in Data Science. Moreover, I also completed a

            Certificate in Data Science</a>.
          For my PhD research I worked in the field of knot theory under the supervision
          of <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~anh.tran3/">Dr. Anh T. Tran</a>.

            src="images/sweet.png" alt="home" />Story of My Sweetest Achievement</h2>
        <p>Bangladesh has the system of conducting a combined final exam for 10th grade students which
          we call Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam. All the students from the entire country
          participate in SSC exam. Students can only proceed to 11th grade if the pass SSC exam. The
          same type of combined final exam is conducted for 12th grade students which we call Higher
          Secondary Certificate (HSC) exam. Without passing HSC studnets are not allowed to start their
          undergraduate studies. When I appeared for SSC there were 786,220 total candidates and when I
          appeared for HSC there were total 501,507 students participating. I ranked 1 out in the entire
          country both in SSC and HSC. Even though at this stage of education these achievements does not
          matter but I love to remember those memories for a reason. With age we require bigger achievements
          to be happy but for a kid any achievement is a great source of joy. I never felt such joy of
          achievements again even though I achived bigger and harder things. That is why this was the sweetest
          achievement of my life.</p>
        <h2><img style="float: left; vertical-align: middle; width: 30px; height: 60px; margin: -10px 10px 0 0px;"
            src="images/philisophy.png" alt="home" />My Approach to Life</h2>
        <p>First of all I know that life is not going to be there forever. In the evolutionary scale human civilization
          is
          here on this mother
          earth for a very short period of time. But no matter how short our existence is, rather than suffering from
          the
          the pain of
          existential crisis we still desire to live better and we get immense joy of discovery through the super power
          of
          thinking.
          We improved ourselves to a point where we can exceed the limitation of our eyes and see through the analysis
          of
          our brain.
          As an example, we can see how the galaxies are or even the whole universe or beyond without going outside of
          our
          tiny little planet
          or in its extreme form without leaving our study room using only a pen and paper we see all possible
          universes.
          But this super power
          of seeing beyond is not a must for survival and we may still fail to survive through a big natural disaster in
          future. So, there is no
          point of being afraid to be failure. Rather trying to explore what is beyond my ability is fun. Moreover, this
          forces the brain to
          think more efficiently and deeply. That is the reason I do not get afraid to handle challenging works and I
          love
          my work. Very rarely
          I do ad hoc completion of any work. As I am not immortal, I always try to make sure that any work I do must
          create some
          permanent windows in the remaining walls surrounding my thinking. I do not feel hesitant to say that my
          ultimate
          goal is to
          achieve the ability of thinking continuously without being tired of going deeper in any angle like an
          olympic
          winner gymnast
          who has the ultimate flexibility of the body, like the voice of a great singer who can travel through all the
          musical notes
          with great accuracy or like a fighter jet that has extreme maneuverability and power. I call these freedom. I
          enjoy my work and
          fly through my thinking and gradually increasing the maneuverability and strength and reaching towards
          freedom. I can neither afford to dislike my work nor I can do it ad hoc as the life is short.
          This is the reason I love my work and I love each moment of my life.</p>

            src="images/hobby.png" alt="home" />Things I Like to Do</h2>
        <p> I love seeing the nature. I like forests, mountains and rivers. I enjoy growing plants. I love animals
          and feel that they are so cute and innocent. But I am not a vegeterian. I like playing table tennis,
          chess and all other games. I tried playing musical instruments like guitar, tabla and flute but couldn't
          master anyone of them. I like to draw pictures. I am very choosy about watching movies as very few movies can
          impress me.</p>
